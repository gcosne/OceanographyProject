**Abstract** : Today satellites provide a surface signature of the temperature with a high spatial frequency but a low vertical
resolution. Thanks to the ARGO database collected by buoys making vertical surveys, one has a precise but sparse knowledge of the vertical thermal structure of the ocean. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology to statistically combine additional information to obtain a 3D time series of temperature sufficiently resolved horizontally and vertically to follow the eddies. Within an observation-driven framework, we investigate the extent to which mesoscale ocean dynamics may be decomposed into a mixture of dynamical modes, characterized by different local regressions between surfacic SST,SSH and Vertical Temperature fields.
